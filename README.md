The topic with clear statement on whether research or application.
Topic: Smart Travel Companion
Type: Application
We will develop a smart travel assistant that integrates GPT power to provide personalized travel recommendations. Users can enter a location and receive curated suggestions for things to do, places to eat, and sights to see.

Problem statement if research project, or system statement if application project.
The system will be a application that allows users to input a destination. It will then return a list of travel recommendations, including attractions, restaurants, and events The application will integrate the OpenAI GPT API.

The core functionality will include:
User input of a destination.
GPT-powered processing to understand the user's preferences.
A clean UI to display results with links, descriptions, and (maybe) maps.
